# Final Product Decisions

## Locked decisions from documentation closure pass

### Public branding

- official public company name: `Demo B2B Catalog`
- short brand for compact UI areas: `Catalog`
- reuse the existing Catalog logo as the website logo
- `CRM Platform` is not the public website brand name

### Typography

- MVP primary font: `Manrope`
- do not introduce a secondary display font for MVP unless clearly justified

### Locales

- supported locales in architecture: `en`, `fr`, `fa`
- public locales for MVP: `en`, `fr`
- default public locale for MVP: `en`
- Persian/Farsi is fully modeled but unpublished and non-indexed
- Persian remains editable/admin-manageable but not public

### Audience and tone

- primary audience: B2B companies and their representatives
- tone and CTA strategy must reflect a professional B2B informational catalog, not retail ecommerce

### Category structure

- categories support multiple hierarchy levels from the start

### Manufacturer meaning

- manufacturer means the main product producer/brand only in MVP
- supplier/partner/reseller concepts are not modeled in MVP

### Product availability

- availability is admin-defined and informational only
- supported statuses:
  - `in_stock`
  - `available_on_request`
  - `out_of_stock`
  - `discontinued`

### Pricing

- products may optionally display a public price
- if no public price is set, the product page must show a contact-for-pricing message

### Inquiry handling

- product/contact inquiries are stored in the database
- inquiries are visible in a dedicated admin section
- no paid third-party service is required for inquiry handling
- email notification infrastructure is optional and non-core for MVP

### Files / product documents

- the system must support attaching files/documents to products
- public exposure of files is supported when content is available

### Cost constraint

- MVP must avoid paid-service dependencies for core functionality
