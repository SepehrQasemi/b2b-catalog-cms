# Sitemap And Information Architecture

## Routing baseline

Recommended public routing strategy:

- Root `/` is not a content page
- Root redirects to `/en`
- All public pages are locale-prefixed
- Only published public locales are publicly routable
- Category detail URLs must support multiple hierarchy levels from day one

Public locales at launch:
- `en`
- `fr`

Architected but non-public:
- `fa`

## IA conclusion

The public IA should stay narrow and strong:

- home
- about
- products
- categories
- manufacturers
- contact

The admin IA should stay structured and operational:

- no arbitrary page builder
- no sprawling settings maze
- no hidden publish states

That balance is appropriate for an SEO-oriented B2B catalog MVP.
