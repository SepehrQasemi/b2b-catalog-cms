# B2B Catalog CMS Repository Cleanup Report

## Purpose

This note summarizes the repository cleanup and publication-preparation pass performed after the implementation hardening work.

## Must-fix items addressed

- repository-facing identity aligned to `B2B Catalog CMS`
- package metadata prepared for public GitHub publication
- local startup and stop wrappers rechecked for clarity and safety
- repo documentation synced to the current implementation and local run flow
- GitHub-ready CI workflow added for lint, typecheck, tests, and build
- admin login persistence hardened by moving cookie-setting login submission to a dedicated route handler with host-safe redirects

## Should-fix items addressed

- support docs split between implementation hardening and repository cleanup
- publication guidance documented explicitly for `SepehrQasemi/B2B Catalog CMS`
- admin/browser smoke coverage retained as part of the repo-quality baseline

## Intentionally unchanged

- original spec documents continue to describe the product itself as the Catalog website
- crm-platform references remain in source-of-truth docs only where they are part of brand/reference analysis
- dependency advisories were not force-fixed because the available automated upgrades were risky

## Outcome

The repository is now organized for public GitHub publication as `B2B Catalog CMS` without changing the product scope or public brand rules.
